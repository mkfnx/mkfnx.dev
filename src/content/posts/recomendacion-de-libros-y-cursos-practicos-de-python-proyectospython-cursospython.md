Some Python book or course with a really practical approach,  this was the answer I gave and that got heart from the person I met.  The first recommendation was the books on the Invent with Python page  of the author of the famous book "Automating Boring Things with Python."  In addition to this well-known book,  there are also some others that are quite practical,  for example the big book of Python's small projects.  All the books are available to read online for free  and here we see that there are all kinds of projects,  from the traditional ones like prime numbers or rock,  paper or scissors,  or to some more innovative ones like SoundMimic or TextToSpeech that  involve the use of libraries for sound generation and reproduction.  And there is also this one focused on the creation of video games,  starting with traditional games implemented in the terminal,  but then advancing the creation of visual games using PyGame.  Kaggle competitions are also a great choice for learning,  although they are more focused on data science,  allowing participants to post their solutions to the challenges,  which you can read freely and learn about.  Several sites specialized in Python have also  published lists of projects that you can do in Real Python,  they have a whole section dedicated to this,  each article is a complete tutorial in which  they teach you how to replicate the project,  although most are paid.  The geeks for geeks site also has a lot  of Python projects and many of them free,  it is classified by level of experience in  Python and also by type of application such as web,  scrapping,  automation,  computer vision and some others.  DataCamp has a multitude of data-oriented Python projects,  some are on its own site and some others are from external sites like Kaggle.  And finally JetBrains also has a list of  projects that you can start solving from its IDE,  some are free but most are paid,  although you can review the first phases for free  and then continue paying if you liked the project.  Comment if you recommend other practical projects for learning Python and  don't forget to follow me and visit my profile for more content about Python,  data and artificial intelligence.
