These are the projects of the programming  course with Python at Harvard University,  you can access for free all the classes or from the course page,  but if you want to get a certificate you have to complete these  projects for each of the units of the course there will be several  problems to solve these are the topics of the course starts with  the fundamentals of any language conditional variable functions and cycles,  and goes to more advanced things like the use of libraries,  unit tests and object-oriented programming and in the end you also  have to create a project with everything learned in the course  some of the most interesting or curious projects are these in the  making Faces you have to replace these symbols representing little  faces which is how we used to send messages before there were emojis.  In this coke machine,  the operation of a soft drink machine must be simulated.  When a purchase is made you indicate an amount of money that is inserted  and the program must give the amount of change that is given in vanity  plates we have to create a custom board validator they give us certain  rules for the boards and we have to validate if  several examples that give us comply,  for example,  if it has the expected number of letters and  numbers and starts with the allowed letters,  in this Bitcoin one a program is created to give us the cost  of a certain amount of Bitcoin at the time we run the program.  For this purpose,  web analytics libraries are used to  consult a simple API that gives us the price.  This one from Cookie.  Jar is about object-oriented programming.  And here we simulate the operation of a cookie jar,  that is,  if we add or remove cookies that carry the account of how  many are left if you can add more depending on capacity,  in this "shirtify" you use a library to edit images,  you have to put that image of the t-shirt on one of your photos or on one  of these example images and remember that if you complete all give you a  certificate of part of CS50 this is completely free but there is also an  option to get a payment by edX and also remember that CS50 has communities  on all these pages where you can request help or connect with other students.
