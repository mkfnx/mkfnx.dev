I asked netflix for my information and  analyzed it using python and data science libraries.  Then I created some visualizations like this  infographic that shows some of the data I found.  Also some graphics to show the top movies and series I've seen and also  a heat map indicating the times and days when I watch the most content.  The info that netflix gives you is a  ship file with all these folders and files.  In this pdf called covership they explain what each of the files contains.  The one I used to analyze my information is this so-called  view in activity which contains info about all the shows,  such as the time you started it,  the profile where you saw it,  the device, etcetera.  I edited it in google collap and visual studio code and  created several functions to process dates and titles of content.  I leave a link to google drive so you  can analyze your info and create graphics.  Although before doing so you will need to request  your info to netflix and you can do so at this address.  Comment if you would like more content of this type.  How to analyze data from another platform or details  about the code to process the info and create the graphs?
