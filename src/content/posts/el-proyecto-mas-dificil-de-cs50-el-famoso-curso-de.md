That's right,  the most difficult project of Harvard's  famous computer science course is called Tideman,  which is about implementing an algorithm to identify the winner in a vote.  Tideman is for the case where several  options are indicated in order of preference.  To determine the winner,  three steps are followed,  first determining who would be the winner among each pair of candidates,  then ordering the results according to the margin of victory.  Finally,  a directed network is assembled with holes  that originate in the direction of the winners,  taking care not to form cycles in the network,  since we are going to identify the  winner by locating the origin of the network.  This part of detecting cycles in graphs is probably the most difficult.  Comparable leetcode issues are labeled as medium difficulty,  but it should not be forgotten that the course  in which this problem appears is beginner-focused,  that the topic in question is only the  fourth and should be programmed in C language.  Even experienced programmers recognize the difficulty of the problem and  several mention that it is even more difficult  than most activities in their work.  There was a petition on Reddit about creating  t-shirts to commemorate when you solve this problem.  If you want to try to solve the problem yourself,  you can visit this URL.
