second part of what the tasks are like of the Harvard course in introduction to computer science this week's Lab it's about determining the blood type of a person in a family tree Structs from the C language are used for this task. dynamically created in memory with malloc and free and pointers to link or create relationships between family members and the problem of the week will be just one that is a spell corrector in this one we are given a very large text in which we have to look for words that are misspelled A hashtag ball or spreadsheet is used for this problem. which allows us to locate elements very quickly and it is a topic that is also asked about in many job interviews. The week 6 is about Python and the Lab. consists in creating a program that allows estimating the probabilities of a country winning the World Cup football and the problems of the week will be Mostly about replicating problems that you had already solved in C. but now with python this so that you can compare and experience the differences between a low-level language and one of a high level how are c and python only program that had not been done in c is the DNA one which discusses identifying which person belongs to a DNA subsection to solve this,  various python string handling functions are used. Week 7 is about SQL the language that allows us to interact with databases both the Lab and the problems of the week are here They consist of answering a series of questions. on the data in the database,  and for this You have to create a series of queries for each of the questions. The Lab's database is about songs. It includes an exercise in which a known value like Audio Aura is calculated. and that is used on Spotify to create the end-of-year countdown the other databases are one about movies and the other is basically a clone of the SQL Murder Mystery. which is a game in which with the information from the database you have to find out who committed a crime week 8 is about HTML,  CSS and JavaScript in the app you have to create a website for a trivia that allows users to respond to questions that are shown on the page It's more or less like a Google form. and the problem of the week is about building a homepage or personal page. that contains information about you as a mini-biography and interests or hobbies or something like that and week 9,  the last one of content,  is about Flask. a Python framework that allows you to create the backend of a web application this week's Lab It is a page to store birthday dates of your acquaintances. Unlike the websites from the previous week Here you are already going to store information in a database. and for the problem of the week You will need to create a page that allows simulating  the purchase and sale of shares. here in addition to the database You also integrate an API or APIs. through which you get the information about the actions as the availability and price and for the last week you will have to create your own project in which you apply everything you learned during the course on the project page They provide very detailed information about  everything that needs to be included. if you need inspiration You can check out the project gallery that have been created by students in previous years of everything you can imagine as bot games desktop web applications mobile phones etc.  and finally that would be all the work needed to get your course certificate On my blog at this link or in my profile,  I leave a post with the videos I have created about CS50.
