Palm's chief tech man carried the wooden block everywhere for months,  simulating it was a real device and pulling it out of  his pocket whenever he needed to log or get information,  and it wasn't until he was sure that using the device would be quite  comfortable that he decided to continue with later stages of development.  IBM tested to validate voice-to-text conversion  technology rather than having a functional system.  They used a person who captured the words.  Thanks to this,  they discovered several problems with the use of this type  of technology and decided not to continue with the research.  At that time,  this type of super low technology and  investment tests was as "Pretotyping" by Alberto Savoia,  a former Google executive,  this term is a clear reference to the word  combined with the word Pretend (or pretend),  because as we saw in the initial examples this technique requires pretending or  imagining that certain functionality or device is real and as you can imagine,  its objective is to validate a product  with the lowest possible cost and effort.  All the details about this interesting technique you  can find in the pair of books written by its creator,  the first is a free book created with the same preotype technique and  the second is the evolution of that book preotype once the concept was  validated and which you can find in different book stores I leave links  to those books on my profile page as usual you will also find links to  past recommendations and links to my other social networks and other content.
