Like LeetCode but for Linux servers,  on this site you will find server management challenges  that will help you develop problem-solving skills or as  a practice for DevOps or Site Reliability interviewing.  The site issadservers.com and so far there are 34 challenges available,  classified by difficulty level and by topics such as bash,  docker, Java,  SQL and several others.  On the page of each challenge you will find its description,  the expected solution and the time limit you have to solve it.  Pressing the "Run" button starts the virtual server you have to fix.  After a few seconds you will see a link to go to the server  terminal where you can start executing the commands to solve the challenge.  It is also possible to request clues or even  consult the solution if you get stuck at any point.  Then you check your solution and if it is correct,  the server is destroyed and your result is displayed,  otherwise you can continue playing.  The results are saved in this dashboard so you can see them later.  Besides everything,  the project is open source and you can find the code in this GitHub repository.
