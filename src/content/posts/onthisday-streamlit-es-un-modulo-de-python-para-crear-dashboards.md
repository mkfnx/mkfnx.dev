With this tool you can create interactive web applications  only with Python and without the need to use html6 or.  This tool is called streamlink and was created to solve the problem of  putting machine learning and data science projects into production.  Starting with streamlink is very easy,  just install the corresponding package using  the package handler of your choice.  Then you import the package into your script and you  can start using the Lite stream components.  Finally,  use the Stream Lite run command to run your application.  Here we are going to run the demo that includes several examples like  the ones I showed at the beginning,  for example this one of graphics.  Streamlite also offers a free service to host your application.  Just link your GitHub project and complete a simple setup page and in a few minutes  your project will be available on the internet for everyone to see.  I use streamlab to complete a couple of pending projects,  a transaction data infographic and a stat to find a partner.  You can try these projects and see the corresponding  code in the link to my profile.
