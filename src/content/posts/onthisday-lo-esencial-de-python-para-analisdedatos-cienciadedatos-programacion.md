This is the essentials of Python for data analysis,  they are the minimum of functionalities  you need to know in order to start working.  Data awareness in Python,  we see how little it is and compare it to the  list of topics in the official Python tutorial.  What are all these?  We are going to review it in this notebook from Google colab,  which I already talked about in a previous video.  Log in to colab,  you will see a screen like this one that allows you to open recent  examples or files and below it allows you to create a new notebook.  We press there.  This is how your new notebook will look,  the only thing it contains is a gallery  where you can start and executing Python code.  Here we see how we write Python code,  press run and it will show us the result here.  It takes a while for the first time you run code because it starts  connecting to the computer or the environment  where the notebook code is executed.  You can add more codes with these buttons here or texts.  The idea of notebooks is that you can  intercalate the code with some explanation of the code,  that's why you combine text blocks with code blocks.  Here I have already placed my text block,  when you finish editing it is displayed with the indicated format.  After a while of editing it,  your notebook looks more populated.  One of the most common operations in  computers is to perform mathematical operations,  because obviously in Python we can also do it,  we simply write the operation as we are used to and that's it,  I changed a little bit here so we can see how it gives us the value.  There it is.  Of course it has all the other operations we are used to.  Something important to observe here is that although we write  several operations we are only seeing the result of the last one,  this is because this is how a notebook works,  to show all the information or results we want we have to use the  print function explicitly and this way we see the result of all the  operations and to form the result we use a function known as f strings.  Allows you to combine text with in Python.  Another super common thing for work in data science is  to make use of external modules such as the famous pandas,  numpy, scikit, etc.  In Python there are many modules or packages,  both official and created by other users,  if you want to know more about them you can  google or consult the Python package index.  A common module that you could find is the math module,  to start using it we have to write import  math or some other variant to import modules.  For example,  we are calculating factorial,  logarithm,  cosine and using the value of the constant pi.  Another super important point are the variables,  which can help us to accumulate partial results of our operations.  It can help to better understand the code,  since for example,  up here that is the formula for a circle.  It is not read as clearly,  but by defining some variables to which we give suitable names,  we can make it more readable and read much more  clearly that the area equals pi per radius squared.  Finally,  the lists and the statistics package.  When we analyze data,  we receive a lot of information.  This is generally grouped into structures such as this list.  This list allows us to refer to all values at once  and handle them as if they were a single variable.  And many statistics and data functions will  also require you to work with these structures.  For example,  here the calculation of mean,  medium and fashion requires a list.
