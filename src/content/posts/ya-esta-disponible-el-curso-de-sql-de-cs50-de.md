The CS50 SQL course,  the famous computer science course series from Harvard University,  is now available. I already talked about this course in a recent  video that I left linked in this one. We're going to see a little bit about how to register to start taking it. The easiest way is to simply review the course content,  which you can access through this link where  you can see each of the course units,  but if a certificate is of interest,  then sign up for this link from the edX platform.  In addition to this verified certificate,  there is a free one. I leave another linked video that explains this. Each course unit has an individual page where you can find the class video,  additional material such as the slides,  notes or code seen during the class and something very important: the  problem set (or task) for each unit. Here on the tasks page,  instructions are given for setting up the environment and the  description of each of the problems. Each problem also has its own page and here all the description and everything  necessary for you to solve it is also given,  for example a demo of how it should work,  previous code that gives you information about the structure of the database and  the tests you should perform to verify that it is correct. Tell me in comments what other content you would like to see about this course,  for example a summary of the classes,  an explanation of the tasks or anything else that you can think of.
