The 2023 database is postgreSQL. This is according  to the ranking created by the sitedb-engines.com,  which measures the popularity of database handlers using the  number of mentions on different internet sites such as search engines,  Google trends,  Q&amp;A sites,  job exchanges or networks such as and Twitter.  On the website of the ranking creators you can find more  information about 417 database handlers of different types,  such as technical information,  links to learning resources and even job offers.  And if you want to learn how to handle the top database of 2023,  I recommend this Coursera course,  a postgreSQL major for everyone,  created by the University of Michigan and taught by Charles Russell,  who is also the creator of the popular Python course for everyone.  This specialization consists of 4 courses.  All course content is free and you can  also pay to obtain a verified certificate.  I leave the link to the course in the link in my profile.  You can also find my playlist content so you can see  everything about the content you are most interested in.  In addition to links to my social networks and all  the content I have recommended in my other videos.
