Can you cheat in a programming interview using chatGPT?  The siteinterviewing.io conducted an experiment to test just this.  This site is dedicated to connecting engineers from large technology  companies with people who want to practice  interviewing in those same companies.  This is how the experiment was designed.  Interviewers were not informed that the goal was to detect the use of chatGPT,  while interviewees were told that they had to use chatGPT and  even try to rely much more on chatGPT than on their own abilities.  A total of 37 interviews were conducted in three groups.  In the first group a question extracted from  leetcode was evaluated without any modification,  in the second group a leetcode question with some modifications and in  the third group a question that was not easily found on the Internet.  An important fact is that the interview was conducted without video,  only with audio because the platform seeks to  protect the privacy of both interviewers and interviewees.  However they refer to cases like the ones seen in this video,  which would make it easier to cheat in an interview  even if the video was active* these were the results.  A control group that had 53% success in passing the interview was used.  In this group it is assumed that there is no use  of chatGPT because there is no incentive to use it.  In the group that was evaluated with unmodified leetcode questions,  73% success was obtained,  in the group of modified questions,  67% success was obtained,  and in the group of questions that do not appear on the Internet,  only 25% success was obtained.  This is in line with the expected performance of chatGPT which behaves  very well with information that has probably been in its training such  as leetcode questions and reduces its performance as that data changes.  However,  it should be noted that even in the  category of questions with slight modifications,  a better result was obtained than in the control group.  As a fact,  no one was found to be cheating,  which makes sense because of the above,  that someone is unlikely to seek to cheat in a preparation interview,  so it is likely that even if the interviewers had detected some  suspicious attitude they would not have associated  it* with seeking to be cheating.  And the problems mentioned with candidates who  did not pass the tests were: non-optimal solutions,  extreme cases not taken into account,  messy code or poor communication as well as personality  problems or being very slow programming which may have  been associated with waiting for the chatGPT response.  An important message for the companies is to immediately change questions  that they have used before and that could be available on the internet and a  very simple technique to trick code generators like chatGPT is to mask the  problem with a story here they put this example of a very popular problem  called the sum of two in which they add a short story about a girl's  birthday and this simple modification was enough for  chatGPT to give an incorrect answer.  Finally they give some tips on how to create good interview questions  and in general the site has very good material for both companies and  developers looking for work do you think it is easy to cheat in a real  interview or do you think companies are already ready to detect these cases?
