So are the projects of the programming  course with python from harvard university.  You can access for free all the classes or from the course page,  but if you want to get any certificate you have to complete these projects.  For each of the units of the course there  are going to be several problems to solve,  these are the topics of the course,  it starts with the fundamentals of any language,  functions, variables,  conditionals and cycles,  and goes up to more advanced things like using libraries,  unit tests and object oriented programming.  And at the end you also have to create a  project with everything learned in the course.  Some of the most interesting or curious projects are these,  in the making faces project you have to  replace these symbols that represent faces,  which is how we sent messages before there were emojis.  In this cock machine you have to simulate the operation of a soda machine,  when you make a purchase you indicate an amount of money that is  inserted and the program must to give the amount of change that is given.  In vanity place you have to create a custom plate validator,  they give us certain rules for the plates and we have  to validate if several examples they give us meet it,  for example if it has the expected number of  letters and numbers and starts with the allowed letters,  and so on.  In this bitcoin a program is created to give us the cost of  a certain amount of bitcoin at the time we run the program,  for them they use libraries of web requests to  consult a simple api that gives us the price.  This one of cookiller is about programming between  objects and here we simulate the operation of a jar of cookies,  that is if we add or remove cookies,  that it keeps the count of how many are left,  if they can add more depending on the capacity,  and so on.  In this shrektificate a library is used to edit images,  you have to put that image of the t-shirt on one  of your photos or on one of these example images,  and remember that if you complete all of them you get a certificate from cfc,  this is completely free,  but there is also an option to get a paid one from edex.  And also remember that cfc has communities on all of these  pages where you can ask for help or connect with other students.
