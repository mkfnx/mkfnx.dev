This is how a single library broke the entire package registry.  The library is called "everything" and actually had no useful function.  It was simply something the creators did as a joke,  as they found it funny that there was a  library that depended on all the other libraries in.  But they did not take something into account.  Due to another well-known incident in,  making your package all-inclusive caused  no other library to be removed from npm,  which can bring security and maintenance barriers for other libraries.  But as the intention was not to cause harm or anything like that,  they quickly contacted the GitHub and npm  teams to warn them of the problem they had caused,  although they did not get a quick response,  as this occurred on December vacation days.  But eventually both the npm package and the GitHub code were removed.  But if you want to see a little bit of the  experience of what it's like to install all the packages,  they also created a site where you run a simulation of this,  and in the end you're going to find a surprise.  On the site of one of the authors they tell all the technical details about  publishing the package and about the incident  they caused and how it was resolved.
