Free course to learn SQL for data analysis,  offered by the Udacity platform.  It lasts approximately 4 weeks and is  intended to be taken from a beginner level.  These are the topics seen in the basic SQL course where you learn the,  FROM and WHERE commands,  as well as the use of INNER JOIN and LEFT  JOIN logic operators to combine multi-table data,  aggregation functions such as COUNT SUM,  MIN and MAX,  along with some other functions such as CASE and DATE and handling null values.  Then another sub query unit and temporary tables,  a data cleaning unit and finally a window functions unit.  Course materials are YouTube videos that can generate English subtitles,  but a text summary of the main concepts is also displayed.  You will have an interactive SQL environment in  which you can perform queries to solve several quizzes.  The database that we work with throughout the course is on purchase orders.  Select the solution for all exercises so you can verify your answers.  They include some other evaluation activities  such as column listing or multiple-choice questions.  I leave you the link of the course on my  profile page or you can visit this link.  Comment if you would like to have a thorough review of any units of the course.
