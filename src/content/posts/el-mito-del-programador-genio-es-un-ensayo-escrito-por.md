Genius programmers are a myth.  So say two former Google engineers in this 2009 Google I/O  talk that has also been replicated in other conferences and  books such as Debugging Teams and Software Engineering at Google.  The authors of the article were working on Google Code,  a hosting system for open source projects that was in operation until 2016.  They received many requests for features that allowed people to hide code.  This showed that many people suffered from insecurity  about their work and wanted to avoid any kind of  criticism and instead give an appearance of perfection and genius.  The problem is that this type of behavior has important risks and consequences,  for example a slower progress in projects that work alone or also the  accumulation of knowledge in a single person with the risk of losing all  this information if the person leaves this project or something else happens.  The antidote to the genius programmer's fantasy is to note that  software development is teamwork even the largest and most  successful software projects are not the work  of one person but of an entire team.  To build or find a great team you have to  develop three fundamental social skills,  respect and trust.
