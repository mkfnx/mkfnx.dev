These are the tasks and problems of the Harvard course  in introduction to computer science,  to obtain your certificate for this course,  you must complete these tasks and a final project with at least a 70% grade. These are the topics for the 10 weeks of the course and therefore of the tasks,  they cover from programming languages and  their characteristics such as scratch,  c, python, arrays,  etc.,  to more general topics in computer science such as algorithms,  data structures,  and memory management. The first task is a project in scratch which is this more visual and  simple programming environment than one in a traditional programming language,  each problem has a very detailed description page  that explains what you have to do,  how to test it,  some examples about it and even videos to clarify  common doubts about the problems. There is a task page for each week of the course that lists exactly  what you have to submit in each week,  for example for this second week,  three things have to be submitted,  first a hello world described there in point three,  in point 4 we are told that we have to submit  one of the two versions of a problem,  depending on how much prior knowledge you have,  you can submit a more or less simple version or a slightly more complex one  and on other occasions you can also choose between two different problems  as in point 5 you can submit the cash problem or the credit problem,  for week two in addition to the "hello world",  a program that prints this pyramid which is like one of the Mario  bros obstacles has to be submitted. And in the difficult version,  you have to program these found pyramids,  for the problems to choose,  you can submit this one which is about giving the exact change  based on an amount they give you,  which is a common problem that they ask in other places like freeCodeCamp  or even in job interviews,  the other task option is a program that validates the digits of a credit card,  in some weeks like in the third,  you will have to submit a type of programs known as Labs,  these are used to practice the concepts seen in class as many people said that  the traditional problems used to be very difficult and the Lab just from the  third week is about implementing formulas for the growth  of a population of llamas like these,  for the third week's Lab,  you have to calculate the points that a word in the  game of scrabble and three problems,  one,  calculate the readability index of a statement with a formula they give  you and two of the following four,  a conversion of binary digits to words. Caesar cipher which is a method of hiding a message by replacing its  letters with others from a different position in the alphabet. Substitution ciphering,  which is also for hiding messages,  but that is something more complicated than the previous  ciphering or a version of wordle,  which is this game of guessing words that was very popular last year. For week three,  which is about algorithms,  we have to implement some voting algorithms.  The first one is called plurality,  which is what we all know,  where the person who has the most votes wins.  The next one is called run off,  where you vote indicating the level of preference you have for each option.  And the next one is Tideman,  which even uses graphs to determine who is the winner. This problem is the most difficult and there are even official  t-shirts to recognize when you manage to solve it. This week is about memory,  the Lab is about translating a text file into a drawing  in an image file like this face,  there are two problems,  one is to implement image filters such as edge detection,  grayscale or mirroring the image and choosing one of two problems,  recover deleted images or reverse wav files that are audio. I was missing from week 5 onwards but I didn't have time anymore. Like or comment if you want me to describe the missing problems?
