In this 2015 chart it was said that the weight of the used in  some websites began to exceed even that of some video games and  if the trend continued it was said that we were going to reach  the weight of Doom and now sites like Slack reach the size of Quake 1.  This post from the sitetonsky.me analyzes how much emphasis is on modern pages.  They analyze several pages of famous websites ChatGPT uses 7,  YouTube 12 megas,  Discord uses 21 megas,  TikTok with 12.5 megas,  Instagram with 16 megas,  who knows what for but uses 31 megas and a very prominent one that apparently  cares about optimization is this one here with only 1.4 megas and of course,  honorable mention to JQuery who after all this time  continues to use only 100kB for his landing and to the  category of those they use the most were called elephants.  Here are just the ones you expected Jira with 50 megas and Slack with 55.  To give us a better idea of how heavy these numbers are,  let's compare them with a reference of 10 megas 10 megas of code,  which would be the equivalent of 150,000 lines of 65-character code  compared to a site like Google Maps with functionality  that is considered complex,  it only uses 4.5 megas,  although Google does not also do it on other pages since,  for example,  the search engine uses 9 megas.  They conclude by making a consideration about the use of resources and if the  functionality of a site is as basic as in  a blog it may be an excess to use many,  many times more to show only that content.  Let me know in the comments if you consider that using  all this is justified and how much does your site use?
