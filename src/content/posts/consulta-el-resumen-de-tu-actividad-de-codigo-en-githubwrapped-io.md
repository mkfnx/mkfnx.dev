InGitHubWrapped.io you can get a summary of your GitHub activity for the year.  To get your summary just visit the page,  give a star to the GitHub repository of the project,  enter your user name and press the Go button.  And after a few moments it will show you the corresponding views.  The summary contains the traditional commit  history graph and some data about the activity,  such as the number of active days,  the longest streak of consecutive days sending commits,  the longest period of time without sending  commits or the days you were active at the weekend.  It also shows the analysis of your lines of code,  such as the most used languages,  the most active repositories and finally,  details about your contributions,  such as the type of activity you had,  be it commits,  reviews,  issues or pull requests,  contribution graphs per month and per day,  and a dispersion graph of the hours in which you usually send those commits.  Views from previous years are also available.  And using this button at the bottom of the page,  you can also download this visualization to share it.  You can also check out the summary of famous  software developers such as Linus Torvalds,  the creator of Linux,  or Evan You,  the creator of Vue.  This visualization is open source and is part of the GitHub trends project.
