Learn software architecture with real examples of open source applications.  In this series of books more than 70 authors  explain how they designed and built their applications.  The first two volumes of the books are focused on architecture,  the third is focused on performance and the last  on smaller code fragments of less than 500 lines.  The motivation behind this book is quite interesting,  since the authors consider that there is a  gap in the education of most programmers,  they mention that in comparable professions such as building architecture,  many cases of great works built by other professionals are studied,  but that this is not something that happens in software,  since most of them only know the architecture of projects  they have worked on or that they themselves have have designed.  This lack of references and studies can lead to  repeating the same errors over and over again.  The examples included range from simple drawing applications to more  advanced tools such as compilers and other software  with millions of lines of code.  These are some outstanding applications  of the examples reviewed in these books,  the LLVM software construction suite that includes compilers,  debuggers and several other things,  the Mercurial version control system,  the Selenium web driver,  the Hadoop distributed file system,  the SQL library for Python,  SQLAlchemy processing.js,  a very popular tool for creating animations,  Moodle, nginx,  matplotlib and many more.  There is also a section where you will  find brief information about the authors,  including a brief description of their professional activities and  links to their personal sites or where you can learn more about them.  Most are professors or researchers at prestigious universities or  professionals with extensive experience in large software companies.  These books are available for free in their HTML version at this address,  although you can also purchase printed or other  electronic versions at various sites listed here,  such as Lulu or Amazon.  Comment if you are interested in having one of  the chapters of these books reviewed in detail.
