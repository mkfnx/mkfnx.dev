Malware attack targeting developers seeking employment.  It was built by Phylum,  a software construction security company.  The first thing they detected were some npm libraries with malicious code,  in which they used the modified name of already known libraries.  For example,  they used the nameexecution-time-async,  trying to be confused with execution-time,  which has more than 27,000 weekly downloads.  And already within this package they placed obfuscated code in testing files.  When examining the code,  they detected that its purpose was to steal user credentials and,  worse,  to take control of the device in order to even execute remote commands.  They also identified some IP addresses from  which additional malicious code was downloaded.  These addresses and other fragments of code made it possible to  identify some of the profiles of the perpetrators of this attack,  to the point of them with a published job offer in which they were  looking for senior front end developers for a cryptocurrency project.  It was later learned that this was related to a  previous investigation by the Palo Alto Networks team.  This report mentions that the campaign is  even related to hackers from North Korea.  You can find all the details and updates of this incident on Phylum's site,  where you also find a link to Palo Alto Networks' detailed report,  which was published in November last year.
