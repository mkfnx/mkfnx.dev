This is the course with which I fell in love with data science,  it is called the analytics edge which  translates something like the advantage of data analysis.  It is available for free on the meet open cursor page.  The reason I love this course is because it is full of practical applications  and examples that illustrate very well the  great benefits of using data analysis.  For example here from the main page already mentions the example of  i harmony which was a very famous online dating site and as you can  see here you can download all the materials with this button below  or you can also view them online through this little menu button.  In the menu we are going to see all these  sections which are basically the contents of the course,  its description and the materials.  The videos of the classes you are going to find in these sections of  units and here you can see the topics covered which is from the introduction,  regressions, trees,  closterization,  etcetera.  In the readings section we can quickly see the example cases that are analyzed,  we see that there are about wine quality prediction,  analysis applied to sports as in the case of  moneyball which is a book and a movie by brad pitt,  analysis on medical data of heart diseases,  analysis on decisions of the supreme court of justice.  and several others such as social media analysis or ibm watson.  For each of the examples its data is provided in  sb files that you can download in each of the units.  To perform the data analysis the programming  language r is used as you can see here in section 1.3.  For this course there is no certificate as the platform  on which it is available does not track your progress,  it is simply there to make the content available.  But don't let the lack of a certificate make you  stop taking it as it is a super interesting course,  well designed and entertaining and can even make you feel like brad pitt .
