This is the structure more used for data analysis with Python. As the name says there,  it's about the data frame. and in this colap notebook we are going to review how it works. As we saw in the pandas documentation, A data frame is essentially a table. Each row represents a record or an observation. which is composed for each of the data in the columns. This case We see data from Boston Celtics players. Each one has all those properties,  name, team, number,  position and age, While each row will represent a player. Returning to the code, the first thing that needs to be done is import the pandas module. Here we see a portion of the data we were seeing. in the image of the table. They are defined as dictionaries, which is something very common. For example,  if the data came from an IP, example, this Ipi I found called Bolton live has the data in a very similar format. What we do to create the data frame is simply this line of code and as an argument time passed a list of the data we want it to contain our data frame And that little board below is how it looks. Another very common way to create the data frame is to have the values organized by column. If For example, if Here we have lists for the values of each column. In that case, This is how the creation of our data frame would look like. The argument of the function To create the dataframe,  it would no longer be a list of data. instead it would be a dictionary, specifying The name of the column and the list of its values. And even though they are different instructions, We have the same result in the table. It is quite tedious to create them this way, They are generally going to be created by importing files, but we see that further ahead. Good part is that Once we have a ready data frame, we can start using a lot of functions useful for obtaining information from our data. Example,  here the script function gives us values very common statistics like the average, Standard deviation and percentiles. We can well be Cueris or filters on our data. like this one here. Have players whose age is higher than the average. The code used for this is minimal, at least to me it seems much easier to do so that, for example, in something like Excel. You can see the following video we continue with file data loading so that we can perform data analysis more interest.  If you want to know more about this, check the official documentation or resources like this free book which I already talked about in another video
