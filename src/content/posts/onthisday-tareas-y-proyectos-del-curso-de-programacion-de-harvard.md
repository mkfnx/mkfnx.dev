These are the tasks and problems of the Harvard course  in introduction to computer science.  To obtain your certificate for this course,  you must complete these tasks and a final project with at least a 70% grade. These are the topics for the 10 weeks of the course and therefore of the tasks,  they cover from programming languages and  their characteristics such as Scratch,  c, Python, arrays,  etc.,  to more general topics in computer science such as algorithms,  data structures,  and memory management. The first task is a project in Scratch,  what is this programming environment? More visual and easy than one in a traditional programming language. Each problem has a very detailed description page  that explains what you have to do,  how to test it,  some examples of it,  and even videos to clarify common doubts about the problems. There is a task page for each week of the course that lists exactly  what you have to submit in each week,  for example for this second week,  three things have to be submitted,  first a hello world described there in point three,  in point 4 we are told that we have to submit  one of the two versions of a problem,  depending on how much prior knowledge you have.  You can submit a more or less simple version or a slightly more complex one  and on other occasions you can also choose between two different problems  as in point 5 where you can submit the cash problem or the credit problem,  for week two,  in addition to Lolo world,  a program that prints this pyramid that is like one of the Mario Bros.  obstacles has to be submitted. And in the difficult version,  you have to program these found pyramids. For the problems to choose from,  you can submit this one,  which is about giving the exact change based on an amount they give you,  which is a common problem that they ask in other places like Free  Code Camp or even in job interviews,  and the other task option is a program that  validates the digits of a credit card. In some weeks,  like in the third,  you will have to submit a type of program known as a lap,  these are useful for practicing the concepts seen in class,  as many people said that traditional problems used to be very difficult. And the third week's app is about implementing formulas for the growth  of a population of llamas like these,  for the third week's app,  you have to calculate the points that a word would give you in  the Scrabble game and three problems,  one calculate the readability index of a statement with a formula they  give you and two of the following 4. 1 conversion of binary digits to word. Caesar cipher,  which is a method of hiding a message by replacing its letters with  others from a different position in the alphabet. Substitution cipher,  which is also for hiding messages but is somewhat more complicated than  the previous cipher or a version of World that is this word guessing  game that was very popular last year. For week three,  which is about algorithms,  we have to implement some voting algorithms. The first one is called plurality and it's what we all know where the  person who gets the most votes wins,  Next is called run off and here you vote indicating the level of  preference you have for each option.  And the next one is tie man who even uses graphs to determine who is the winner. This problem is the most difficult and there are even official  t-shirts to recognize when you manage to solve it. This week is about memory Lab.  It's about translating a text file into a drawing  in an image file like this face.  There are two problems,  one is to implement image filters such as edge detection,  grayscale or mirroring the image and choose one of two problems,  recover deleted images or reverse web files that are audio.  I missed week 5 onwards but I didn't like or comment if you want me  to describe the other missing problems.
