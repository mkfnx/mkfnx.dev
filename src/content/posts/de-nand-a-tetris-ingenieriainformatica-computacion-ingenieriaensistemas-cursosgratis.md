This course it teaches you the functioning of computers, to the most basic circuits to games and applications. The course is called Dancing to Tetris, being nant the most basic component from which modern circuits are built. The course is completely free and gratuitous, so You can find it on multiple platforms and sites. The main one is this one here,  nante,  your Tetris dot org. We can also find all the classes on YouTube, but the cursera version is also very popular and helps you keep track of all your progress, in addition to offering a certificate with cost if you complete it. The course consists of 12 units. divided into two main sections, the 6/1 are for hardware and the next 6 for the software. Start with the most basic components or fundamental, as logical and Boolean arithmetic, and with those concepts the components of the computer are being built, for example,  the memories or the logical arithmetic unit. Then the components are used. created in previous projects to create more complex ones, for example virtual machines, operating systems or compilers. In the description of each project let's see a list of the components that we are going to develop. For example, in this,  which is project 5, It is requested to develop a memory and a CPU. to make it easier to take this course. All the components are developed using simulators instead of using physical components. I also highly recommend watching this Ted talk. one of the creators of the course Here he also talks about what the course is like. why he created it and how many people have taken it and they have adopted it in their communities or schools, and also how their efforts are motivated to improve current education, which, he says,  is too focused on qualifications and in trying to measure performance, a place to worry about sparking creativity, curiosity and passion of the students
