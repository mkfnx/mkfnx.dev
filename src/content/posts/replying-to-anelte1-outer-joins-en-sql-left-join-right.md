this article from LearnSQL.com help to understand the LEFT and RIGHT JOIN very well In this example,  we have a table of t-shirt colors. and pants colors This is what the t-shirt table would be. The pants table contains three other colors. This is how the LEFT JOIN instruction is seen. and below is the visualization of the result A JOIN is going to look like this Only the elements that match completely will be included. but as we use a LEFT JOIN here The elements of the left table will also be shown to us. (or the first table we wrote in the query) even if they don't match with the table on the right This is what the results table would look like. This row here would correspond to the player who has no match. but how are we going to list rows and columns The pants simply show it as null (NULL). now we see the RIGHT JOIN the complete outfits are shown but now we are going to show the pants What is the one on the right side of the table? even if it doesn't match and we see that the playera was no longer shown because that is the one from the first tab This is how the query and the result would look like. finally we see the FULL OUTER JOIN What happens here is that the elements of both tables are included. even if they don't have any matches for this FULL OUTER JOIN Thus would be the consultation and the result.
