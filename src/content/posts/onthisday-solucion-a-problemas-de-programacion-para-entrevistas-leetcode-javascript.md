This page contains the video solution to more  than 300 algorithm and data structure problems.  As you can see here it is nickout and the address is  nickout dot i o In the bar above you have this trouble  practice section which is indicated with that pencil icon.  Here we see three lists of algorithm problems and data structures,  The only difference between the three are  the problems they contain All the problems,  it contains all the 308 and the others have fewer problems just to match the  preparation time you have available or the  amount of problems you need to solve.  To practice problems are organized in these topics  here When you are on a topic the list of problems expands,  In each problem you can check if you have already solved it or not,  not have a link to the lead Coast page.  Lead con l is the one who created the problems and  offers an environment for you to solve them there on his site.  Here in nickout with n is where they  offer us the video solution to the problems,  That solution in video because you see it in that little button of the camera,  See a small view of the video there on the same page or you can  go to YouTube by pressing the button of the programming language,  in this case Python,  We can see the code that gives solution to the problem,  in that little box above we can select the  language in which we want to see the solution.  Interesting thing nickod is this section of the world which is a reflection  which is simply this graph that shows us the  recommended order to study the topics.  The very common way to use nickod is to simply Google  the title of the leadcode problem Example here google  SD contains duplicate Quickly we find the nickout video.  Videos from other pages are also available,  but nickout guarantees that you have a lot of nickout problems.
