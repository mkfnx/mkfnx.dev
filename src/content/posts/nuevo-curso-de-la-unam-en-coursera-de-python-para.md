New course created by UNAM on Python oriented to data analysis.  The course is called zero-user Python,  it is created so that you can start it  without any previous programming knowledge,  but it is also intended as the first of a series of  courses to specialize in analysis and data science.  The course is on Coursera's platform,  so you can access all the content for free,  although there is also a payment option of approximately $30 USD that  includes the certificate and gives access to the assessment of assignments.  It has approximately 24 hours of content divided into 4  units and remember that Coursera also allows you to apply  for financial help so that you can obtain the course certificate.  These are the 4 units of the course,  the first deals with the configuration of the working environment,  the second shows the basic Python and data types,  the third reviews the integrated functions in Python,  the fourth reviews the notebooks in detail.  To complete the course and obtain your certificate you will  have to complete a final project consisting of 8 exercises,  which focus on cleaning and data processing.  There are also two additional exercises so that  you can obtain a degree certificate with honors.  I think it's a great course that has a  very good rhythm in the subjects it handles.  The only thing I think we missed adding is  a brief review of functions to import data,  this would open the door to having many more use cases to  apply what we learned or even to start analyzing our own data.  And in the data playlist and Python in my profile I have this  video about it "loading files for data analysis" and several  others that you might like if you are interested in data analysis.
