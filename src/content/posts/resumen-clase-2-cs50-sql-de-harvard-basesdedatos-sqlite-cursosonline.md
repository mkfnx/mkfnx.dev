Harvard CS50 SQL class 2 summary.  This class is about how to create relationships between tables in  our database and how to create queries using these relationships.  The first thing to do is to execute these commands to get an updated  version of the database with which we are going to work in the class,  then we are going to open the database with the sqlite3 command,  then we are going to execute this command  .tables just to see what tables contains the database,  when executing this command we are going to notice that we already  have 7 tables instead of only one that we had in the last version,  that the information of authors and  books is separated each one in its own table,  in a scheme of this style the saved information would look like this,  but this has several obvious problems,  as when we want to save several books of the same author.  To correctly structure a database like this we need to  introduce the concept of relationships and as the name  indicates this is a relationship that exists between two objects or entities,  something very important of the relationships is its cardinality that  indicates the number of elements of one entity that are related to another,  for the example of authors and books we have these cases,  to visualize and communicate the structure of our database,  commonly used are the entity-relationship diagrams that are seen in this way,  the entities are represented with these  pictures and their relationships with these lines,  which indicate the cardinality through the symbols of the apostles.  This diagram can be read as follows,  an author can write many books and a  book can have been written by many authors,  or an editor publishes several books and  zero or more translators translate books,  since translation is optional.  Another important concept is that of keys,  which is a field that allows us to identify a unique way an element,  in the example here shows its usefulness,  since for example a book could share title,  author and format and the only difference was the edition number,  so to solve this type of ambiguity we will look for keys to be unique fields.  In the case of books a common option would be to use the ISBN,  which is a number that will identify a book  with all the above mentioned characteristics,  title, author,  format, edition,  etc.,  since these key fields allow us to uniquely identify an element,  they can also be used as something known as a foreign key,  which will allow us to relate the entities  by including this field in different tables,  for example a list of books with ratings using  the ISBN as a foreign key would look like this,  the book contains a single record with that ISBN and to store each evaluation  of the book we would repeat the ISBN and the correction given by certain user.  However,  there is still a problem with a key that has a type like the ISBN,  and that is that it is artificially long,  since it is built with criteria that we do  not know are assigned by an external entity.  To shorten the length of this field and the space needed to store it,  we can create our own numeric key,  which is usually a consecutive integer starting from 1,  so when repeating the key in the entities we want to relate  we will not have to repeat all the digits of such a long key.  A special case when forming relationships is  that of the relationship from many to many,  which in a relationship 1 to 1 it was enough to include the  field of the fairground key in the table we wanted to relate,  but for the relationship many or many this is not  enough and we have to use something more complex,  we can see that in this example of the relationship between authors and books.  To properly relate these tables we create an  intermediate table known as a junction table or associative entity.  What we are going to do in this entity to indicate a relationship between the  other two entities is to include the primary  keys or identifiers of each of them.  Thus we see that in the example that is attached here we can determine  that for this book of ID. 1 and title "Boulder" the author is Eva  Baltasar with ID. 23 and something similar happens  with the other books and authors.  Like or comment on this video so that  TikTok will let you know about the second part,  in which we will see subqueries and joins to see how to build queries with  which you can obtain information from databases with this type of structures.
