Reviewing the AI and Data Science roadmap at roadmap.sh begins with sections of mathematical foundations statistics and econometrics for a role dedicating to AI or data science the fundamental and most important thing is the statistics and a great resource to learn and reinforce Mathesis topics in Spanish is Bourbaki College. they have completely dedicated courses and plans AI and data science and the teachers are mathematicians,  researchers and data scientists with a lot of experience in the field. there is another section dedicated to programming Here we include Python,  algorithms, and SQL. but the Python recommendations could be better The Kaggle course seems too short to me. and that it doesn't go deep enough And the Google course is already something old. They recommend Leetcode study plans in algorithms. but these plans are more for programming interviews completing some algorithmic course would be sufficient In the following part,  it begins to be combined. programming with statistics Here we have sections of exploratory data analysis. Machine Learning,  Deep Learning and MLOps many of the recommended resources are from Coursera which I think is good because they are courses backed by a university you can view the content for free and pay for a certificate if you consider it necessary and I think they forgot to include this resource what seems fundamental to me and that even has its own course based on this book. Tell me what you think about this roadmap. and if you have any recommendations for material for him and remember to visit my profile and the link in my bio for more content on AI,  programming and data science
