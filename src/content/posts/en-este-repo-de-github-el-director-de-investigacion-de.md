This is how Google's research director learns about programming using Python.  In his GitHub repo called Pytudes you will find  a list of exercises solved and explained by him.  The title comes from the French word études,  which means study and is widely used in the context of music,  and defines exercises as Python programs,  generally small and used to perfect programming skills.  On the main page of this repo you will find  the problems organized into different categories,  for example the most recent logic and mathematics riddles,  word riddles about computer science and algorithms and some others.  The solution of each of the exercises is implemented in a  Python notebook and here in the first column you find links  to different platforms where you can see or run these notebooks,  for example by pressing here the G we get a  preview of the notebook right here on GitHub,  but you can also open it on another platform  like Google colab which would allow you to run it.  If you are not familiar with the platform,  I have a video that I leave linked for each of the problems,  first describes its approach and then explains  the solution interspersed with some blocks of code.  There is quite a variety of topics and several  articles are about things that are happening,  for example when Wordle was popular in  2022 some articles were created about this.  There are also several articles on traditional themes or games,  for example sudoku,  Conway's game of life,  about poker,  the lottery or the traveler's problem and  special mention for those inspired by xkcd comics.  Comment which of the articles you find interesting  and if you would like me to review any in particular.
